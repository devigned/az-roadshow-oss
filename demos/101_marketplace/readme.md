# Marketplace OSS
In this demo, we are going to create a scalable version of Wordpress from the marketplace. This will show how simple it is to setup a complicated stack of Open Source software in Azure through the Marketplace.

## Goals
- illustrate the selection in the marketplace (3500+ components)
- show how easily one can build out a complicated distributed app
- do this completely through the UI, no script needed
- explain the entire stack from mysql up to Wordpress

## Steps
- use an account with a credit card associated (needed for mysql resources)
- login to the portal
- click on new
- click on marketplace
- click on entire marketplace
- search for Wordpress (note the variety of offerings)
- select the scalable Wordpress solution
- enter all of the data needed to build the template
- after this is built, navigate to the ready Wordpress site
